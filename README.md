<h2 align=center>My own libft tests</h2>

- It may be that the tests do not work very well, use with awareness of this.

- Feel free to clone and change these tests to your need.

- The *test_ft_lstdelone* behavior is undefined in some tests, make sure to check what it is comparing.

- In some GNU/Linux systems, some tests that use the strcmp function need the **<bsd/string.h>** to work very well, in these cases you'll need to use the flag `-lbsd` when you compiling the code.

- Make sure to verify that the **bsd library** is installed on your system.
